            <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
            <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
            Lutrix Technologies is located at:<br />
            <address>
                Lutrix Technologies<br /> Gaborone <br />- South East , Botswana<br />267 75 620 565</address>

            <p>It is Lutrix Technologies's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
                operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a
                    href="https://lutrix.co.bw">https://lutrix.co.bw</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
                "https://lutrix.co.bw"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
                information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
                Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and
                under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies
                only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information
                from other sources.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
                rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our
                Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
            <p>Like most website operators, Lutrix Technologies collects non-personally-identifying information of the
                sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Lutrix Technologies's purpose
                in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Lutrix Technologies's
                visitors use its website. From time to time, Lutrix Technologies may release non-personally-identifying
                information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p>Lutrix Technologies also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
                (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://lutrix.co.bw blog posts.
                Lutrix Technologies only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>Certain visitors to Lutrix Technologies's websites choose to interact with Lutrix Technologies in ways
                that require Lutrix Technologies to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
                information that Lutrix Technologies gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
                ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://lutrix.co.bw to provide a username and email address.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
                over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
                acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
            <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows
                ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
                interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Lutrix Technologies and does not cover
                the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>


            <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third
                party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the
                Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
            <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of
                any third party sites, products or services.</p>



            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
            <p>Lutrix Technologies may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Lutrix
                Technologies may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Lutrix Technologies
                does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>


            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Lutrix Technologies uses "Cookies", similar technologies
                and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your
                preferences on your computer.</p>
            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's
                browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Lutrix Technologies uses cookies to help
                Lutrix Technologies identify and track visitors, their usage of https://lutrix.co.bw, and their website
                access preferences. Lutrix Technologies visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
                computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Lutrix Technologies's websites, with
                the drawback that certain features of Lutrix Technologies's websites may not function properly without
                the aid of cookies.</p>
            <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and
                agree to Lutrix Technologies's use of cookies.</p>



            <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Lutrix Technologies may change its Privacy Policy from time
                to time, and in Lutrix Technologies's sole discretion. Lutrix Technologies encourages visitors to
                frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after
                any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
